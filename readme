Information
Description:-
We will make an app which will check current temperature of any location round the world. User will have to type the name of place 
and then it will displaythe current temperature of the location, but if the user wants to know about more details then they must 
have to signup or login. After signing up, they can check minimum temperature, maximum temperature, feels like and all other details
like that and they can edit this as well they whether they want to see this is future or not. They can also add a location, so that 
in future they donâ€™t have to type it again and again. There will be can other option for current location as well, by clicking on it,
it will display the temperature details of the current location.

Screen Details:-
-Signup: for signing up as a new user
-Login Screen: login using username and password
-add locations: User will be able to add maximum 5 locations at a time
-temperature: details about the weather
-Forecast: Weather check for 14 days

Challenges:-
Our main challenge is working with database and connecting it with Android Studio, as we have never worked with that and next thing 
would be making list of saved locations to make it easier to check weather of selected locations. But we will try our best to complete
this project and make it a success.
